				<h2>Hello World</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Silvia Puglisi. I am a software engineer and Ph.D. candidate
					at UPC Barcelona Tech.
				</p>
				<p>
					I research in privacy and web science.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am here to talk you about the real dark web.

				<h2>What has marketing to do with this?</h2>
				<p>
					Think of the so-called <em>new economy</em> without online marketing and advertising..
				</p>
				<p>
					Aehm.. You probably can't.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most of the successful <em>online</em> companies of the last.. make it 20 years.. use advertising to sustain their business at least in part.

				<h2>The source of advertising</h2>
				<p>
					Advertising wants you to buy products.
				</p>
				<p>
					So advertising companies are doing all that they can to know you so
					they can recommend you products that you are more likely to buy.
				</p>
				<p>
					The source of advertising is <strong>data</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Data</strong> about you.

				<h2>How does Online Marketing work?</h2>

				<p>
					eMarketing follows users in their online and sometimes offline activities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Information about what users do and are interested in are collected
					by websites, applications, devices.
				</p>
				<p>
					This information is crawled, analysed and categorised.
				</p>

				<h2>What about online privacy?</h2>

				<p>
					If our actions on the web are constantly collected and analysed. Do we have online privacy? Have we lost our right to be anonymous?
				</p>

			</section>

			<section>
				<p>
					In an online context, the right to privacy has commonly been interpreted as a right to “information self-determination”.
				</p>
				<p>
					Acts typically claimed to breach online privacy concern the collection of personal information without consent, the selling of personal information and the further processing of that information.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Is Privacy the right to be forgotten?</h2>

				<p>In 2011, the amount of digital information created and replicated globally exceeded 1.8 zettabytes (1.8 trillion gigabytes).</p>

				<p>75% of this information is created by individuals through new media fora such as blogs and via social networks.</p>

				<p>By the end of 2011, Facebook had 845 million monthly active users, sharing over 30 billion pieces of content.</p>

				<h2>The age of the metadata</h2>
				<p>
					“meta-data” is collected and stored by public and private organisations about where, when and who created and accessed a particular online content.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>
					Websites have embeded structured data for a few years now.
				</p> -
				<p>
					Structured data is used to describe product, services, events, and make user information available already into their HTML pages using markup standards such as Microformats, Microdata and RDFa.

					## Let's make a few examples

					Google Conversion Tracking

					```
					<html>
						<body>
							<!-- Below is sample text link with a phone number.
									 You need to replace the number with your own
									 phone number and the CALL NOW text with the text
									 you want to hyperlink. -->
							<a onclick="goog_report_conversion('tel:949-555-1234')"
								 href="#" >CALL NOW</a>
						</body>
					</html>
					```
				</script>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>How does convertions tracking work?</h3>
				<p><em>Let’s say your Google search ads send people to your website where they research and learn more about your business. Website call conversions dynamically inserts a Google forwarding number on your website that measures the calls made by these customers. Whether they click on the number or dial it directly from their phone, you can attribute the call conversion and conversion value back to the keyword and ad that drove the customer. You can learn more about setting up website call conversions here.</em></p>

				<h2>Unique footprints</h2>
				<p>
					While you surf the web you carry a unique footprint:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>HTTP cookies, often set by with 3rd party analytics and advertising domains</li>
					<li>sessions and storage.</li>
					<li>Browser or device personalised settings. Resolution, Fonts, Plugins.</li>
					<li>Accounts ID.</li>
					<li>Devices ID.</li>

			<section>
				<h2>How unique is a footprint?</h2>
				<p>
					To answer this question we can do a set of different things.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We can profile our activity within a set of categories</li>
					<li>We can calculate how many bits of information are introduced everytime we add a feature to our profile.</li>
					<li>We can analyse how many unique feature we are sharing across the network.</li>
